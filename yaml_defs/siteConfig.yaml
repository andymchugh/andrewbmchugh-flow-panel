# These scalars provide a way for grafana variable settings to adjust the threshold
# limits. They are explained in the panelConfig documentation. These scalar
# rules across the two files are additive. As in the panelConfig rules are added first, then
# the siteConfig rules are postpended to the variable rule arrays. As such panelConfig rules
# get the first opportunity to match.
