# YAML Anchors and Aliases simplify maintenance. This is an example of an anchor
# for a link. The corresponding alias would look like:
#   link: *grafana-home

anchorLinks:
  - link: &grafana-home
      url: "https://grafana.com/"
      params: "time"

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Test Settings

# Version 1.6.0 onwards: This section details test settings used in validating the functionality.
# They provide a way to drive particular code pathways.
test:
  # This changes the test timeSeries to be sparse and is used as a way to demonstrate the
  # difference between datapoint 'last' and 'lastNotNull'. Undefined defaults to false.
  testDataSparse: false

  # Version 1.11.0 onwards: By default the base offset on the curves is 1 so they travel from
  # 0 to 2. By shifting it to 0 you can have a range of -1 to +1 to test negative data.
  testDataBaseOffset: 0

  # Version 1.11.0 onwards: When set you get an extended set of datapoints around zero to facilitate
  # testing in this region.
  testDataExtendedZero: false

  # Version 1.12.0 onwards: When set test data values are extended with a string-data timeseries.
  testDataStringData: false

  # Version 1.16.0 onwards: When set test the data values are extended with a 'no-time' timeseries.
  testDataNoTime: false

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 1.14.0 onwards: The zoomPanPinch yaml provides customization of the zoom-pan-pinch
# behavior. It can be defined in either panelConfig or siteConfig.
zoomPanPinch:
  # This optional term defines the array of keys that can be used to enable wheel zoom. There's
  # a clash of interest between panel zoom and dashboard scrolling which is easy to avoid with small
  # SVGs, but becomes more problematic when the SVG is large and covers a lot of the screen. By
  # requiring a combo such as ALT+Scroll this clash can be avoided. 
  wheelActivationKeys: ["Alt"]

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Version 1.14.0 onwards: This section defines panel level defaults for the link window
linkWindow:
  # Default for '<cell>.link.sameTab'.
  sameTab: true

# Version 1.14.0 onwards: Link variables will be substituted in urls prior to passing through
# grafana variable substitution. Variables should be defined in the same format as grafana variables.
# i.e. ${urlBasePlugin}. These variables can be defined in siteConfig or panelConfig.
# Alongside these bespoke variables there are two reserved variables driven from the cell yaml of:
# ${cell.name}
# ${cell.dataRef}
# Substitution order is: siteConfig-vars -> panelConfig-vars -> reserved-vars -> grafana-vars
linkVariables:
  urlBasePlugin: "https://github.com/andymchugh/andrewbmchugh-flow-panel/blob/main/"
  urlBaseGrafana: "https://app.diagrams.net/"

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Grafana Variable Scalars

# These scalars allow the grafana variable selections to impact the threshold values
# used in the panel. Each grafana variable has an array of rules where a rule applies
# to a subset of cells as defined by the cellIdPatternScope.
#
# At initialization the rule set for each cell is determined. Then at render time the first
# rule on a cell to match the variable value results in that scalar being applied. The scalars
# are accumulative across variables, but only the first rule match for a given variable will
# be applied.
variableThresholdScalars:
  system:
    - {variableValuePattern: ".*client.*", thresholdScalar: 2, cellIdPatternScope: [".*box.*"]}
  environment:
    - {variableValuePattern: "dev", thresholdScalar: 0.2, cellIdPatternScope: ["inbox_depth"]}

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Highlighting

# Version 1.6.0 onwards: The Highlighter legend, when enabled in the panel options, uses this
# configuration to display the legend and highlight/lowlight the readouts based off of selection.
# Only legend tags that also exist on cell definitions will be selectable. As such you can add
# legend entries that are purely descriptive to make the tags understandable by a wider audience.
#
# This configuration works in tandem with cell level configuration. On each cell a tag array can
# be defined allowing a cell to be highlighted in multiple dimensions.

tagConfig:
  # The legend will be displayed when the Highlighter is enabled in the panel options. The array entries
  # should be either 'tags' defined on cells or descriptive text or separators. If not defined a legend
  # will be deduced from the cells tags arrays.
  legend: ["Queue Technology:", "rabbitMQ", "kafka", "|", "Flow Attribs:", "inflow", "depth", "|"]

  # This defines the legend color to apply to the tag when the tag is selected. If not defined
  # it defaults to yellow.
  color: "yellow"

  # This defines the rgb factor to apply to a readouts color when the readout is highlighted. Note the
  # rgb ratios are always maintained so this will result in this factor being capped. If not defined
  # it defaults to 5.0.
  highlightRgbFactor: 5.0

  # This defines the alpha factor to apply to a readout when other readouts are highlighted.
  # i.e. selections get highlighted. non-selections get lowlighted. If not defined it defaults to 0.3.
  lowlightAlphaFactor: 0.3

  # Version 1.7.0 onwards: When set this flag uses a thinner footprint for the combined highlighter
  # and timeSlider. Enable when vertical space is at a premium. Default when undefined is false.
  condensed: false

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Panel Config

# Version 1.6.0 onwards: When undefined the background color is not driven. When defined the color for
# the current theme is used. Colors can be entered in all the normal ways of name, hex, hsl, etc.
background:
  darkThemeColor: "yellow"
  lightThemeColor: "green"

# Version 1.17.0 onwards: This defines color mappings for themes. Colors defined in the cell drives
# can be mapped to theme specific overrides. SVGs created with draw.io 26.0 onwards contain
# both light and dark theme color definitions which means the static parts of the diagram will automatically
# respond to the theme. These mappings ensure the dynamic part of the SVG displays with the most aesthetic
# contrast. Like all colors, they can be defined in all the normal ways of name, hex, hsl, etc. The applied lookup order
# for the colors is: panel cells -> panel cellColorMappings -> site cellColorMappings -> site colors.
cellColorMappings:
  darkTheme:
    red: "light-red"
    orange: "light-orange"
    green: "light-green"
  lightTheme:
    red: "red"
    orange: "orange"
    green: "green"

# Version 1.6.0 onwards: This defines which datapoint will be chosen from the time-series.
# If your datasource supports graphite functions 'keepLastValue' and 'transformNull', using those
# functions in combination with 'last' gives the most precise control. If you don't have them available,
# 'lastNotNull' allows you to approximate it. With 'last' the closest datapoint based off the timeSlider
# position is chosen. With 'lastNotNull', that datapoint is then walked back in time until a non-null value
# is found.
#
# This is the panel level default which when undefined defaults to 'last'. It can be overriden at the cell
# level and the cell-attribute level.
#
# Valid values are undefined, "last", "lastNotNull"
datapoint: "last"

# Version 1.19.0 onwards: This section defines how the grafana query data should be transformed.
dataRefTransform:
  # This defines how query data is named. When false, query data is named as the data would be seen in
  # a time-series panel legend. When true, that name is given a '<queryName>.' preamble. Note that not all
  # datasources will support this. The queryName is sourced from the query result 'refId'. If not present
  # and the flag set, a default value of 'GBL' is used. The flag defaults to false if not defined.
  # This term is useful for people who can't provide unique display names across queries.
  namespaced: false

  # This 'queries' section defines per-query specialization terms.
  # 'tabularKeyColumn' defines how tabular (as opposed to timeseries) data cells can be addressed.
  # When set, tabular data gets transformed into a dataRef per keyColumn value. Note this is only ever
  # needed if the table contains more than one row.
  # i.e. Given a returned table from query "A" of:
  # | name                | size | mediaType | 
  # | --------------------|------|-----------|
  # | browser_marketshare |   45 |       csv | 
  # | weight_height       |  123 |       png | 
  #
  # and yaml config of:
  #   dataRefTransform:
  #     namespaced: true
  #     queries:
  #       A: {tabularKeyColumn: "name"}
  #
  # the following dataRef names will be available for driving cells:
  # - A.browser_marketshare.size = [45]
  # - A.browser_marketshare.mediaType = ["csv"]
  # - A.weight_height.size = [123]
  # - A.weight_height.mediaType = ["png"]
  queries:
    ParticularQueryName:
      tabularKeyColumn: "columnNameToSourceDataRefNameValuesFrom"

# This defines the default color gradientMode. It defines the default value on cell labelColor.gradientMode
# and fillColor.gradientMode for when the field is undefined. Values are "hue" and "none" with
# "none" being the default when undefined.
gradientMode: "hue"

# This defines the preamble that will be added to every svg ID listed under 'cells'.
# It can be an empty string, which is the default value. DrawIO at the moment adds a non-configurable
# 'cell-' as shown here.
cellIdPreamble: "cell-"

# During initialization all inner cells that are id-free are assigned a new ID based off the
# parent ID. By default they will be given the id <original-id><cellIdExtender><increasing-number>
# where cellIdExtender will default if unset to "@flowrpt". If for any reason that causes your SVG ID
# clashes you can change the cellIdExtender value. But normally it's just left unset.
cellIdExtender: "@flowrpt"

# This is the default label decimalPoints setting that will be used if no override exists at the
# cell level. 'null' represents grafana's 'auto' mode. It will default to 0 if left undefined.
# This panel level override is added after version 1.4.0. In earlier versions the auto mode is not
# achievable.
cellLabelDecimalPoints: null

# This defines the set of cells that are going to be driven
cells: 
  # Each field name is the svg ID. i.e. within config this cell will be identifed as
  # 'inbox_depth'. Within the actual svg the id will be the same name prepended with cellIdPreamble,
  # e.g. 'cell-inbox_depth'.
  inbox_depth:
    # The dateRef defines the name of the time-series. This is the default time-series that will
    # be applied to all configured attributes on this cell. Note that you shouldn't set it to
    # the Grafana query name, but to a time series returned by a query (e.g. for InfluxDB, that would
    # be the 'Alias' name).
    # It can be overriden on an attribute by attribute basis.
    # See 'dataRefTransform.namespaced', defined at the panel scope, for whether the name entered here
    # should be namespaced with the query name.
    dataRef: "test-data-large-sin"

    # The label field defines how the text in the cell will be adjusted based on the

      decimalPoints: 0

      # Version 1.11.0 onwards: valueMappings is an array of 'match-criteria -> text' that allows you to

      # is found value formatting (with units) continues as normal.
      #
      # value: [optional] value must match this term.
      # valueMin: [optional] value must match or exceed this term.

      #       pass through grafana variable substitution.
      #
      # Criteria can be specified as an exact match, a range, just a min, just a max or no criteria

      # This defines the coloring gradientMode. When set to "hue", color values will be interpolated between

      # Thresholds define a color, a value and a global-order. The threshold array-order matters.
      # The time-series value is compared to each threshold breaking out when it spans the surrounding
      # thresholds. The base color is the first threshold color. The first threshold value is relevent
      # only in the "hue" gradientMode as it determines the value at which the color should start to transition.
      #
      # The order term (from version 1.14.0) determines how a threshold compares across threshold sets.
      # It defaults to the array index and only needs to be explicitly defined when threshold sets are being

    # Version 1.17.2 onwards: This defines the element filter for fillColor. A cell-id defines

    # represented with many elements that combine to create a background with forground detail.
    # FillColor applied uniformly on these complex shapes would result in the loss of the
    # foreground detail. This filter, specified with an array of patterns, allows you to control
    # which elements should be driven. If 'name' or 'position' aren't specified they default to
    # the capture-all pattern '.*'. i.e.
    # [{name: 'rect'}] - This will drive all 'rect' elements in the tree.
    # [{name: 'rect'}, {name: 'path', position: '(1|3)'}] - This will drive all 'rect' elements and the first and third 'path' elements.

    # shapes underpinned by the 'path' element the bounding box is more approximate.

    flowAnimation:
      # Optional attribute level override for the associated time-series.
      dataRef: "test-data-large-cos"

      # Version 1.16.0 onwards: Optional alternative data source for the cell taken from the bespoke drive
      # scope. When set it's used in preference to the dataRef value.
      bespokeDataRef: null
    
      # Optional attribute level override. Requires corresponding attribute level dataRef override.
      datapoint: "last"

      # The optional absolute data value at or below which the animation will be stopped.
      thresholdOffValue: 0

      # These terms define the conversion from incoming data values to animation durations. The longer
      # the duration, the slower the animation.
      thresholdLwrValue: 100
      thresholdLwrDurationSecs: 1
      thresholdUprValue: 600
      thresholdUprDurationSecs: 0.1

      # Version 1.16.4 onwards: The optional biasPower applies a curve to how the animation speed ramps in.
      # The algorithm determines a normalised (0-1) value from the threshold value terms and then raises it
      # to this power. The power defaults to 1 which results in a linear ramp. Set it below 1 (and above 0)
      # and the speed ramps in more quickly. Set it above 1 and it will ramp in more slowly.
      biasPower: 1.0

      # Animation speeds (above) are calculated based off of the absolute data value. The direction
      # of the animation is determined off the sign of the data, unless this flag is true.
      unidirectional: true

    # Version 1.16.0 onwards: The bespoke section allows you to drive 'HTML element attribute values'
    # directly via your own 'mathjs' formulas. When you tag a 'cell' in your SVG you are actually tagging
    # an 'HTML element tree' containing all sorts of types such as 'g', 'div', 'rect', etc. By driving the
    # attributes directly on these individual elements you can manage truly bespoke widgets on your panel.
    # Elements in a cell are highly coupled and all that complexity normally gets managed by the SVG editor.
    # It's important when overriding these attribute values that the change is applied in a coherent way.
    # i.e. Rather than change the 'width' and 'height' attributes on a 'rect', instead change the
    # 'transform->scale' and 'transform-origin' on the root element of the cell. Doing this ensures everything
    # remains coherent with respect to features like the fill level drive and the cell label positioning.
    #
    # As well as driving element attributes, the values calculated in the 'mathjs' formulas can also be used as
    # the source data value for the other drives such as label, labelColor, strokeColor, etc. Via this pathway,
    # all drives can be driven from a client-defined mix of incoming data sources.
    #
    # The bespoke drive can be thought of as the following layered process:
    # - Define a namespace, a collection of cell-ids that will share bespoke values. Then in the namespace:
    # - Define a set of constants.
    # - Extract element attribute values into that set of constants.
    # - Run a set of formulas using the above constants, grafana variables and incoming dataRefs.
    # - Drive a set of element attributes using the above formula results.
    # - Source other drives (label, labelColor, etc.) from the bespoke values calculated in the formulas.
    #
    # All formulas are presented with a state object that contains:
    # - The constants you've defined and extracted.
    # - A 'utils' Framework object containing functions:
    #   - log = function(...) -> void. Forwards through to console.info. For developing and debug use.
    #   - variablesReplace = function(string) -> string. Grafana variables defined in the string in the normal
    #     '${myVar}' way are replaced in the result with the actual grafana variable values.
    #   - highlighterSelection = string. Name of the tag selected. Empty string if nothing selected. ( Version 1.17.5 onwards)
    #   - highlighterState = string. Cells highlighter state. Values are 'Ambient', 'Lowlight', 'Highlight'. This is
    #     only available for use within drives.attribsSet mathjs formulas. (Version 1.17.5 onwards)
    # - data : Object containing an item for every dataRef defined in the namespace.
    #
    # The best way to understand this drive is to explore it via a provisioning/dashboardData example such as the
    # bespokeDrive.svg/bespokeDrive.yaml example. Start with this working example, add utils.log(data) in a formula
    # to see the incoming dataRef values you have in the console, then iterate slowly towards your goal.
    # See https://mathjs.org/examples/index.html for mathjs formula usage.

    bespoke:
      # Optional namespace for the bespoke values store. It defaults to the cell-id so by setting it you allow values
      # to be shared across a set of cell-ids.
      namespace: "myWidget"

      # Optional dataRef additions. The cell-level dataRef and all dataRefs listed here will be present on the
      # data object given to the 'renderFn'.
      dataRefs:
        - "test-data-large-sin"

      # Optional datapoint override. Requires corresponding attribute level dataRefs override to be applied. Note that
      # data is gathered on a namespace basis so where multiple values exist within a namespace the most permissive of
      # the set is used. i.e. lastNotNull
      datapoint: "last"

      # Optional set of constants that will be available within the bespoke data store. Intended use is where formulas
      # are shared across widgets and you want to feed in 'template specialisation terms' such as which dataRefs should
      # be used in the formulas for this widget.
      constants:
        # variable-name -> constant value pairs
        clockDataRef: "test-data-large-sin"

      # Optional array of mathjs formulas. Each formula will be called in array order and values set within the formula
      # will be available to downstream formulas in this namespace. The formula passed in receives the scope object
      # described at the top of the bespoke section.
      formulas:
        # mathjs formula array
        - "a = abs(data[clockDataRef])"

        - "utils.log('this is some of my namespace', clockDataRef, boxX, boxWidth, a, grafanaMyVarValue, data)"

      # Optional array of drives to be applied to the cell tree. Each drive will be presented in array order to each element in
      # the cell tree, subject to the optional filter specified by 'elementName' and 'elementPosition'. The drive allows
      # you to fetch element attributes at initialization and then set element attributes at render time. 
      drives:
          # Optional name filter. When set the elementName must match for this drive to be called.
        - elementName: "rect"

          # Optional position filter. When set the 1-based elementPosition must match for this drive to be called.
          elementPosition: 1

          # Optional attribute fetch object. The attribute values are stored at panel initialization.

          # Optional attribute set object. The attribute values are mathjs formulas. To ensure no javascript can
          # be injected, the following restrictions exist on which attributes can be set:
          # - The attributeName cannot start with 'on'.
          # - The attribute has to either pre-exist on the SVG (after parsing through dompurify) or exist in the set:
          #   ['transform', transform-origin', 'visibility', 'opacity', 'fill-opacity'].
          attribsSet:

    # The link defines the url to open if the cell is left clicked. Links defined in yaml can be
    # relative or absolute and go through grafana variable substitution. Note that links defined
    # directly in the SVG are opaque to the plugin and so get dealt with by the underlying framework.
    # If defining links in the SVG, absolute links should pass through correctly.
    link:
      # URL to open. It can contain parameters and those parameters can contain grafana variables.
      # The link can be relative or absolute.
      url: "https://drawio-app.com"

      # This defines what portion of the dashboard params should be added to the URL. Appended parameters
      # will correctly post-pend on any existing parameters in the above URL. The params values are:
      # 'none': this is the default
      # 'time': this is particularly useful where a relative time-band is being used as these relative terms
      #         aren't available as grafana-variables.
      # 'all': all params will be appended
      params: "time"

      # Version 1.14.0 onwards: When set the url will be opened in the same tab unless the
      # <CTRL> or <SHFT> overrides are depressed. When undefined the setting falls back to
      # the panel level 'linkWindow.sameTab' and then to the site level 'linkWindow.sameTab'.
      sameTab: true

    # This defines an ID to a link defined in the siteConfig. If you want to share a
    # link just within the panelConfig you should instead use a yaml anchor/alias.
    # The above 'link' field takes precedence. Only if undefined will linkRef be
    # checked.
    linkRef: "drawio"

    # Version 1.20.0 onwards: Click actions impacting the current window. A cell
    # is clickable if it has a link defined (see above) or if it has clickActions.
    # Supported actions are:
    # - Setting grafana variables
    # - Setting the Highlighter bar selection
    # Clicks support an 'on and off' click-toggling concept. For highlighting that means
    # the first time you click, the highlighter selection is applied. If you click the
    # same cell again, the highlighter selection is reset. For grafana variables
    # the 'on' values are applied on first click and the 'off' values on
    # second click. If the 'off' values are not defined, the 'on' values are reapplied.
    clickActions:
      # Grafana Variable values will undergo grafana variable substitution
      # as well as reserved variable substitution prior to assignment. The following
      # reserved variables are available for use: 
      # ${cell.name}
      # ${cell.dataRef}
      grafanaVariables:
        on:
          myVar1: "on-myValue1-${cell.name}"
