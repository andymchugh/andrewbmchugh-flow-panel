# This panelConfig is intended for use with Svg1. It differs from the main panelConfig
# in that it uses grafana suplied RandomWalk time-series. This is useful for demonstrating
# that the panel works with externally provided time-series. However as we have no say on
# the range of values, it's not that useful as a demonstrator of thresholds.
