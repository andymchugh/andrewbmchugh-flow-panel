# Grafana Flow Panel Plugin
The plugin was created from this [grafana template](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/tutorials/build-a-panel-plugin). It provides side-by-side metric visualization on SVG diagrams. You provide the SVG diagram along with configuration on how you want the diagram to behave. The panel then combines these with your time-series data to bring your diagram to life.
