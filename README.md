# Grafana Flow Panel Plugin
The plugin was created from this [grafana template](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/tutorials/build-a-panel-plugin). It provides side-by-side metric visualization on SVG diagrams. You provide the SVG diagram along with configuration on how you want the diagram to behave. The panel then combines these with your time-series data to bring your diagram to life.

## Getting started with creating panels
Go to the [documentation](https://github.com/andymchugh/andrewbmchugh-flow-panel-docs/blob/main/README.md) repository for full details on how to use the panel.

## Getting started with adding new features
Go to the [Grafana Getting Started](./grafana-getting-started.md) guide to get going with downloading a fork and setting up your test environment.
Once up you'll find three dashboards available (from the provisioning directory) that act as demonstrators for the functionality.
